The code provided is actually a configuration file in the properties format, not a Java code file. Therefore, there is no Java version associated with it. 

To upgrade the configuration file to be compatible with Java 17, you don't need to make any changes as it is not Java code. Configuration files are typically written in a format that is not tied to a specific Java version.

If you need to make any specific changes to your Java code to be compatible with Java 17, please provide the actual Java code.
