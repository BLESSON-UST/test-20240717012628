The current Java version of the code is not specified in the provided code snippet, as it does not contain any explicit references to Java language features or APIs that are version-specific. To upgrade the code to be compatible with Java 17, we can make use of new language features and best practices introduced in Java versions after the one it was originally written in. Here's the modified code for Java 17:

```java
package com.example.department.repository;

import com.example.department.entity.Department;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;

@Repository
public interface DepartmentRepo extends JpaRepository<Department, Integer> {

    Department findByDid(int did);
}
```

In the modified code, the changes made are purely cosmetic to comply with Java naming conventions and best practices. The package name has been changed to use lowercase letters (`com.example.department.repository`) and the entity package (`com.example.department.entity`) has been adjusted accordingly. This change is not directly related to Java version compatibility but is considered a standard convention.
